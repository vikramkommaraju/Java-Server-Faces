1. We need faces-config.xml file to be present in webapp/WEB-INF. Otherwise the application will not load the html page
2. BookEJB must strictly only have EJB methods and not define any DataSources!
3. DataSources are defined in DatabasePopulator
4. If a Java class is marked as @Named, it becomes a Backing bean. Important thing to notice about this is it must satisfy all the qualities of a bean.
It must have VALID getters and setters. Otherwise, when you try to use EL to access bean properties
such as #{bookController.book.title}, it complains saying 

Caused by: javax.el.PropertyNotFoundException: The class 'github.vikram.javaee.jsf.BookController' does not have the property 'book'.
